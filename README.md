# LED Controller HD

Welcome to the **GoWired LED Controller HD** repository! This repository hosts the open-source software and configuration files for the GoWired LED Controller HD, designed to deliver flexible, high-power, multi-channel LED control for both wireless and wired setups.

## Project Overview

The GoWired LED Controller HD is a robust, expandable controller suitable for residential and industrial use. It supports both **wireless communication** options through Tasmota or ESPHome, as well as a custom **GoWired-based firmware** for users who prefer wired setups.

### Key Features
- **Multi-channel LED control**: Precise control over multiple high-power LED channels.
- **Wireless communication**: Easy integration with Tasmota and ESPHome for seamless wireless operation.
- **Wired communication**: Our custom GoWired-based firmware offers a robust option for wired communication enthusiasts.
- **Open-source**: Software is licensed under **GPL 3.0**; hardware design is licensed under **CERN Open Hardware License**.

## Repository Structure

- `Tasmota_configs/`: Configuration files for Tasmota to set up and customize your wireless GoWired controller.
- `ESPHome_configs/`: YAML configuration files for ESPHome, tailored to the GoWired LED Controller HD hardware.
- `GoWired_firmware/`: Our custom firmware developed specifically for wired communication, based on the GoWired platform.
- `Docs/`: Detailed documentation on installation, configuration, and usage for both wired and wireless setups.
- `Examples/`: Example projects and sample code for integrating the controller.
- `Tests/`: Tests for validating code stability and performance.

## Hardware Repository

The hardware design files for the GoWired LED Controller HD are hosted separately and are licensed under the **CERN Open Hardware License v2**. Access the hardware files, including schematics, PCB layouts, and the BOM, in the [GoWired hardware repository on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gowired/led-controller-hd).
